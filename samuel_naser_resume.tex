\item Authored design proposal for and implemented Istio feature that reworked the mechanism through which Citadel (cluster component which enables service-to-service and end-user authentication) targets active namespaces
\item Implemented feature which allowed Istio Gateways (ingress and egress points for Istio mesh traffic) to communicate over encrypted connections with internal workloads through Envoy's Secret Discovery Service (SDS)
\item Implemented a debug endpoint for the Istio nodeagent (critical component for SDS) as part of the full rewrite of the \emph{``istioctl proxy-status''} command
\item Created and tested the default Grafana dashboard for visualizing Citadel metrics, contributed to Istio's migration from Prometheus to OpenCensus metrics

\item Designed and implemented application which enabled traders to toggle which strike prices should be evaluated in our internal pricing engine, now in active use through all trading teams across the firm
\item Spearheaded effort to Dockerize web-team applications, created internal base image with core dependencies for other teams to base their images on
\item Created full stack web application with which traders and tech leads were able to communicate with one another through posting, voting, and commenting on project proposals

\item Leveraged the OpenCensus framework to add distributed tracing to Kubernetes object lifecycles, made it possible to visualize these traces in Stackdriver, Zipkin, and various other tracing backends
\item Authored Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal which introduced a model for distributed tracing in Kubernetes (titled \emph{``Leveraging Distributed Tracing to Understand Kubernetes Object Lifecycles''})
\item Created mutating admission webhook which injects trace context into Kubernetes objects, and which was adopted as an official sig-instrumentation project
\item Utilized this custom trace tooling to isolate bugs in production Google Kubernetes Engine clusters

\item Processed high-throughput advertisement transaction data using Apache Kafka and Apache Samza, reassembled the digital transaction chain in real-time, deployed data-streaming backend onto AWS infrastructure
\item Migrated from JSON to redesigned Apache Avro models at each step of our Java data-streaming backend, dramatically increased message transmission speeds and improved code structure with this refactor
\item Developed and maintained critical Python utilities which transformed outputs from our data pipeline into a format usable by our API, configured CircleCI test environment and wrote integration tests for these utilities

\item Pioneered systems that allowed users to contribute to physical tasks, such as picking up packages or delivering food, with minimal disruption to their existing routines. Researched incentive structures for unpaid user-contributions to non-monetized community platforms
\item Leveraged Node.js, Swift, and MongoDB to implement an application stack that allowed users to post food order requests, and intelligently notified users passing restaurants to pick up the order if it's conveniently on their route
